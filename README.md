# Project Title

Diagnosis-of-Gastric-Cancer-Using-MIFNET-Algorithm


# About the Project
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumours with poor prognostic results. It remains one of the deadly diseases with poor prognosis.
The worldwide shortage of pathologists offers a unique opportunity for the use of artificial intelligence assistance systems to alleviate the workload and increase diagnostic accuracy.Â 
Endoscopic examination is mainly utilized for early detection, while pathological confirmation and CT scanning are suggested for further treatment.
To overcome this problem, this project develops a method using deep learning algorithms to assist the  diagnosis of gastric cancer as it involves numerous tests to arrive at a conclusion. 
Thus, this project helps in effective diagnosis of gastric cancer using MIFNET Algorithm with higher accuracy than the existing models.
A web application is developed to predict the presence of the disease.
